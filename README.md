## ðŸ“œ Project Description  
The Sales Analysis Dashboard provides an interactive and comprehensive view of sales performance. It integrates Excelâ€™s advanced analytics stack to perform **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**, data modeling, and visualization in one file.  

**Power Query Editor** is used to import and clean raw datasets (Orders, Customers, Products), merge them into a unified table, handle missing values, and create calculated columns such as *Order Delivery Time* and *Average Customer Spend*.  

**Power Pivot** establishes relationships between tables and uses **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to calculate KPIs:  
- **Total Orders**  
- **Total Revenue**  
- **Average Delivery Time**  
- **Average Customer Spend**  
- **Top Products by Revenue**  

The dashboard features **KPI cards**, **bar charts**, **line charts**, and **trendlines** for identifying performance patterns. Slicers and timelines allow instant filtering by Occasion, Category, Order Date, and Delivery Date, enhancing interactivity.
